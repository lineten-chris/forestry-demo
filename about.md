Lineten was formed in 2013 to sustainably combat the underutilisation of delivery assets.

Led by some of the best minds in the telecoms industry pioneering B2B auto-activations, we developed technology that would create a community for delivery providers to own and share a space, optimising our platform as a funnel for delivery opportunities.

The platform was built on two pillars: Integration and Aggregation.

Through our aggregation technology, we defined a place where every delivery company could harness their potential and grow to meet the demands of their customers.

At Lineten, we coined ‘Delivery for all’, not because we love catchy lines (we do) but because we are one of few that can definitively enhance the capabilities of every delivery provider, it’s users and of course the experience of the customer.
